Hence we set $\\vec{g}=0$ and $\\vec{f}_\\mathrm{ext}=0$ from here on.\n",

These equations are nearly identical to the 2D Burger's equations that we have already solved (Step 8). The only new terms are the pressure gradients on the right-hand sides. These terms introduce a slight complication, stemming from the fact that we don't have an evolution equation for the pressure. So how can we evolve it?\n",

    "Pressure is related to the density of the fluid through an equation of state. Evolution of the density and pressure are governed by the continuity equation. But for an incomressible fluid, the continuity equation yields the non-dynamical constraint, $\\nabla\\cdot\\vec{u}=0$. So there must also be a constraint on the pressure. To obtain it, we take a divergence of the Navier-Stokes equation. If we do this analytically, after some simplifications this leads to the following Poisson equation for the pressure\n",

    "However, we cannot expect $\\nabla\\cdot\\vec{u}=0$ to remain satisfied in the discrete world. Numerical errors will always creep in, violating the incompressibility constraint. There are two approaches for handling this. One approach is to enforce the constraint on the initial data once and for all, and then evolve those data freely (checking to what extent the constraint is still satisfied at the end). This is called free evolution. The second approach, called constrained evolution, is to enforce the constraint at each step in the evolution. We will take the second approach.\n",
